# An Overview of Recent Advances in Path Integral Control
This is the code repository of a tutorial overview of Path Integral (PI) approaches for stochastic optimal control and trajectory optimization. Different case studies were performed in MATLAB and ROS2/GAZEBO environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stochastic control method for trajectory optimization.
