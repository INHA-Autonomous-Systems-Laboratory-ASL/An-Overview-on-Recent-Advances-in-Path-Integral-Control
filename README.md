# An-Overview-on-Recent-Advances-in-Path-Integral-Control
This is the code repository of a tutorial overview of Path Integral (PI) approaches for stochastic optimal control and trajectory optimization. Different case studies were performed in MATLAB and ROS2/GAZEBO environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of stochastic control method for trajectory optimization.
