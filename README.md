# ROS2/GAZEBO: An Overview of Recent Advances in Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Control
This is the code repository of a tutorial overview of Path Integral (PI) approaches for stochastic optimal control and trajectory optimization. Different case studies were performed in ROS2/GAZEBO environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stochastic control method for trajectory optimization.
